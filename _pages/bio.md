## Hi, I'm Gavin Scoville

I am intently interested in developing solutions to the world’s most challenging water resource issues. As resource issues have evolved over time, my focus has shifted from preventative measures—such as utilizing environmental economics to internalize water pollution externalities—toward adaptive strategies like building artificial reef structures. Because the water cycle trickles through every aspect of our economy and ecology, this resource requires an interdisciplinary management approach. I am excited to apply my diverse background, love of stochastic systems, strong quantitative skills, and unending passion for creative problem solving to researching hydrological systems.
