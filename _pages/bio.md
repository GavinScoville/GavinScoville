## Hi, I'm Gavin Scoville
My research interests revolve around solutions to some of the worldâ€™s most challenging water resource issues. As resource issues have changed over time, my focus has moved from preventative measures such as utilizing environmental economics to internalize water pollution externalities, towards adaptive strategies such as building artificial reef structures. Because the water cycle trickles through every aspect of our economy and ecology; this resource requires an interdisciplinary management approach. I am excited to apply my diverse background, love of stochastic systems, strong quantitative skills, and unending passion for creative problem solving to researching hydrological systems.
