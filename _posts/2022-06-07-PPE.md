A research project investigating whether spending more money on public schools leads to measurable improvements in student outcomes.

### A map of K–12 education spending by county:

In my junior year at Western Washington University, for *Econ 407: Topics in Microeconomics*, I identified a natural experiment. In 2017, Washington suddenly changed how it funded K–12 schools. After compiling a panel dataset, I conducted an econometrics study examining whether increased public school spending in Washington State improved student performance. The results suggested reverse causality: school funding tended to increase in response to declining performance, rather than driving improvement. I failed to find evidence that more funding improved a student’s outcomes.

While the project was ambitious for my skill level at the time (2022, when I was just beginning to learn data science), the research question remains important. I include this study here as an example of my early work in applied econometrics and my interest in policy.
