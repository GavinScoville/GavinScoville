In my time at Western Washington University, I was fortunate to work under [Katrina Poppe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p73ev3kAAAAJ&hl=en) at [John Rybczyk's Wetlands Lab](https://wp.wwu.edu/estuary/). The lab studies the morphology, sediment dynamics, and carbon flux of estuaries along the West Coast. During my time there, Katrina was conducting research on esturies including the Skagit, Padilla, and Stillaguamish.

My field responsibilities included collecting sediment cores and taking SET (Surface Elevation Table) level measurements. Acquiring the data required navigating to collection sites through a maze of sloughs and vegetation—sometimes by foot and sometimes by canoe.

SET levels use a column of stainless steel poles, fastened end to end and hammered as deep as 40 feet into the marsh. This pole provides a stable baseline height that will last decades. To measure surface elevation relative to the pole, a swinging arm with 9 rulers is fixed to the baseline height. This is used to take 36 elevation measurements—enough to find the signal in the noise of sediment accretion and erosion.

Our sediment cores were taken on a transect normal to the slough high-tide line. Each core required pounding a corer at least 60 centimeters into the marsh and then digging it out. This column of soil contains the 1963 cesium signature of nuclear testing, which allows us to work backwards and estimate how much soil has accumulated in the past 62 years.

In the lab, we froze the columns and sliced them into centimeter-thick “cookies” for analysis. One of our most common lab techniques LOSS analysis. Some samples underwent LOSS analysis, where each sample is dried, weighed, kiln-fired, and weighed again to estimate organic carbon content.

We would also place samples inside a gamma-ray detector, which measures the presence and intensity of gamma radiation. Using gamma-ray spectroscopy, we could identify the signature of different radioisotopes present, such as cesium-137 associated with 1963 nuclear testing.

Our work supported multiple agencies and research efforts. Most notably, it contributed to Katrina’s PhD thesis estimating the flux of organic carbon into and out of Pacific Northwest estuaries. I am eagerly awaiting the publication of this work, which will address a major gap in the scientific literature with precise, hard-earned data.
