In my time at Western Washington University, I was fortunate to work under Katrina Poppe at John Rybczyk's Wetlands Lab. The lab studies the morphology, sediment dynamics, and carbon flux of estuaries along the West Coast. During my time there, Katrina was conducting research on esturies including the Skagit, Padilla, and Stillaguamish.

My field responsibilities included collecting sediment cores and taking SET (Surface Elevation Table) level measurements. Acquiring the data required navigating to collection sites through a maze of sloughs and vegetation—sometimes by foot and sometimes by canoe.

SET levels use a column of stainless steel poles, fastened end to end and hammered as deep as 40 feet into the marsh. This pole provides a stable baseline height that will last decades. To measure surface elevation relative to the pole, a swinging arm with 9 rulers is fixed to the baseline height. This is used to take 36 elevation measurements—enough to find the signal in the noise of sediment accretion and erosion.

Our sediment cores were taken on a transect normal to the slough high-tide line. Each one required pounding a core at least 60 centimeters into the marsh and then digging it out. This column of soil contains the 1963 cesium signature of nuclear testing, which allows us to work backwards and estimate how much soil has accumulated in the past 62 years.

In the lab we would freeze the columns and then cut them into centimeter samples for analysis. One of our most common lab techniques LOSS analysis, where we dry the sample, weigh the sample, kiln-fire it, and weigh it again to estimate organic carbon content.

We would also place samples inside a gamma-ray detector, which measures the presence and intensity of gamma radiation. Using gamma-ray spectroscopy, we could identify the signature of different radioisotopes present, such as cesium-137 associated with 1963 nuclear testing.

We collected data for multiple agencies and projects. Most notable is Katrina's PhD thesis, estimating the flux of organic carbon in and out of estuaries in the PNW. I am eagerly awaiting the publication of this paper, which will address a serious gap in the scientific literature, with precise and hard-earned data providing clarity to the scientific discussion.
