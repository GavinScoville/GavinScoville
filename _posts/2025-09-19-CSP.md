High temperature particulate materials are widely used in sensible thermal energy storage applications. Increasingly, thermal systems are incorporating non-oxidative working fluids for either particle heating or storage. This study systematically evaluates six coal fly ashes, a promising TES substrate, thermally cycled to 800 °C and 1000 °C in air, argon, and nitrogen. Solar absorptance, specific heat capacity, crystallinity (CI%), and microstructure were characterized before and after cycling, and simple Fe2+ and Fe3+ indices were calculated from reflectance measurements as spectral proxies of iron redox behavior. Results show that atmosphere exerts a stronger influence on absorptance than temperature: inert environments preserve or increase absorptance relative to as received conditions (+12 % on average) whereas air exposure reduces absorptance (−12 % on average). Temperature alone explains <1 % of absorptance variance. The Fe2+ index correlates more strongly with absorptance than either the Fe3+ index or bulk iron content (pooled R2 = 0.83 vs 0.59 vs 0.60) consistent with ferrous-band darkening in the NIR. Sulfate-rich ashes show the largest absorptance losses in air, coinciding with lighter color shifts, hematite XRD signatures and stronger shifts towards Fe3+ bands. CI% increases with temperature across all conditions (mean values: 20 % as received, 25 % in air, 28 % in argon, 48 % in nitrogen). In contrast, specific heat capacity at 550 °C is generally higher in air-cycled samples than in their inert counterparts. These findings underscore key tradeoffs in material optimization: inert atmospheres enhance absorptance and CI%, while air promotes modest gains in heat capacity. Ashes with low sulfate, high iron, and moderate initial CI% may provide the best balance of TES properties.
