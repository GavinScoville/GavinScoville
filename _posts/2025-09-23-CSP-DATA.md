An overview of how I developed statistical models for understanding the properties of recycled coal fly ash. Below is a data visualisation example from the analysis:

In the process of publishing the manuscript [*Effect of temperature and atmosphere on the optical, thermal, and structural properties of fly ash particles*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591025010459?dgcid=author) I built a plethora of statistical models. The manuscript essetially asks:
**"Can higher temperatures or inert gas atmospheres improve the usablity of fly ash for concentrated solar power?"** (yes it can) 
My statistical modeling explores the data farther, asking:
**"What set of conditions can be combined to make the best possible fly ash substrate for concentrated solar power?"**

I am including an abbreviated report on some of the modeling procedures here:
