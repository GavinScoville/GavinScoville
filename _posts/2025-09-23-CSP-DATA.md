In the process of publishing the manuscript [*Effect of temperature and atmosphere on the optical, thermal, and structural properties of fly ash particles*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591025010459?dgcid=author) I built a plethora of statistical models. The manuscript essetially asks 

**"Can higher temperatures or inert gas atmospheres improve the usablity of fly ash for concentrated solar power?"** (yes it can) 

My statistical modeling explores the data farther, asking 

**"What set of conditions can be combined to make the best possible fly ash substrate for concentrated solar power?"**

Below is a preview of a data visualisation produced during the analysis:

I am including a abbreviated report on some of the modeling procedures here:
