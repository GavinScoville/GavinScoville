An overview of how I developed statistical models to understand the properties of recycled coal fly ash. Below is a data visualization example from the analysis:

In the process of publishing the manuscript [*Effect of Temperature and Atmosphere on the Optical, Thermal, and Structural Properties of Fly Ash Particles*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591025010459?dgcid=author), I built a variety of statistical models. The manuscript essentially asks:  
**"Can higher temperatures or inert gas atmospheres improve the usability of fly ash for concentrated solar power?"** (Yes, it can.)

My statistical modeling explores the data further, asking:  
**"What set of conditions can be combined to make the best possible fly ash substrate for concentrated solar power?"**

I am including an abbreviated report on some of the modeling procedures here:
